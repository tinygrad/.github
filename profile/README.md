welcome to tinygrad

the main sub 5000 line tinygrad repo is [here](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)

the sub 1000 line teenygrad repo is [here](https://github.com/tinygrad/teenygrad)

if you want to do things, you want tinygrad. while teenygrad is as capable as tinygrad, it's a lot slower.

but if you only have time to read 1000 lines, read teenygrad. it is 90% a subset of tinygrad

this is [our website](https://tinygrad.org)
